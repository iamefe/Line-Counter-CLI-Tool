That's it! You've built your first command-line tool in Rust. 
This tool reads a file specified by the provided path and prints the number of lines in that file.
You can further enhance this project by adding error handling, 

support for multiple files, or additional options and flags. 
Building command-line tools is a great way to learn about file I/O, 
argument parsing, and other fundamental concepts in Rust.
